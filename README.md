# MyLockheedCodeQuest

Collection of solutions to the various Lockheed Code Quest codes

## Description

Help those who may not understand how to solve a problem start. These may not be the best solutions, and 
they may not be the fastest, but they can be a starting point to build of

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This code requires python 3.14

### Installing

* Press the download button. Code will install via a zipped folder

### Executing program

* Code comes with automatic inputs for testing. Before Code is submitted this needs to be removed from every code
```
sys.path.append('D:\\CodeQuest')
import inputs
inputs.init("inputs")
```

* It is also necceary to replace this:
```
inputs.input()
```
with this
```
sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
```
* Finally, to test different inputs against the code, change the contents of the ```inputs.txt``` file
